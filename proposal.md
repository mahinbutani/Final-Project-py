# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Mahin Says


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A game that mimics simon says. 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The game will have buttons that are colored and will generate a random pattern that the user has to emulate. It will have mutiple functions to help break up the code and different game mechanics. It will have a scoreboard for rounds passed and the game will get more diffcult as the user passes more rounds.  


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
I dont plan on doing this


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
I do not


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
To have one round of the game correctly functioning.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
To have mutiple rounds with all gameplay mechanics functioning properly.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
To have mutiple rounds with all mechanics functioning properly including the scoreboard and colors of the buttons.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to research how to make buttons, a scoreboard, how to assign buttons different colors, and how I will go about creating a new window. My next steps will be to start the code by creating functions I already know how to write. I will need to learn how buttons work in python and how to achieve a properly working scoreboard. I will also need to learn how to make the game visually pleasing.
